# Thing

Failed attempt at trying to nicely model polymorphism

The result, however, is a cool class called "Thing" which when extended grants an object the ability to do something in fixed intervals
 - for example: A switch which when clicked reverts back to its position over time
  - these can be linked to form cool pulses
 - another example: a rectangle which when clicked spins around and slowly stops
  - this makes for a neat color wheel effect
